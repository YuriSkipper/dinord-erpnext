 "description": "To be, or not to be, that is the question:\r\nWhether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer\r\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\r\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\r\nAnd by opposing end them. To die\u2014to sleep,\r\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\r\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\r\nThat flesh is heir to: \u2019tis a consummation\r\nDevoutly to be wish\u2019d. To die, to sleep;\r\nTo sleep, perchance to dream\u2014ay, there\u2019s the rub:\r\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\r\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\r\nMust give us pause\u2014there\u2019s the respect\r\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\r\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\nTh\u2019oppressor\u2019s wrong, the proud man\u2019s contumely,\r\nThe pangs of dispriz\u2019d love, the law\u2019s delay,\r\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\r\nThat patient merit of th\u2019unworthy takes,\r\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\r\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\r\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\r\nBut that the dread of something after death,\r\nThe undiscovere\u2019d country, from whose bourn\r\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\r\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\r\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\r\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\r\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\r\nIs sicklied o\u2019er with the pale cast of thought,\r\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\r\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\r\nAnd lose the name of action.-Soft you now!\r\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\r\nBe all my sins remember\u2019d.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616)\r\nfrom Hamlet, spoken by Hamlet",
